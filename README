Genome Annotation Generator

A console-based program to read, modify, annotate and output genomic data.
Can write files to .gff3 or to the NCBI's .tbl format.


***Example Usage***
In this exciting vignette, you will create a .tbl file from the .fasta and
.gff files provided in the 'walkthrough' directory. You should run these commands
from within the main GAG directory, or else adjust the file paths.

# Run program
python console.py

# Read in data
GAG> readgff walkthrough/gag.gff
GAG> readfasta walkthrough/gag.fasta

# At present we ignore starts and stops when reading the .gff,
# because we found so many errors with our input. So this command is necessary:
GAG> createstartsandstops

# Write .tbl file 
GAG> writetbl foo.tbl

# Go on your merry way
GAG> exit

With any luck, you now have a file in your working directory called 'foo.tbl'. There
may be any number of things wrong with it -- please get in touch with us so we can fix
whatever ridiculous errors we have made. We're all in this together :)
