Genome Annotation Generator

A console-based program to read, modify, annotate and output genomic data.
Can write files to .gff3 or to the NCBI's .tbl format.


***Example Usage***
In the most basic case, you have a .gff and .fasta file and wish to
produce a .tbl file for NCBI submission. You must also have a template
file (extension .sbt).

Assuming the genome files are located in the 'my_genome' folder...

# Run program
python console.py

# Read in data
GAG> loadsession my_genome

# Write .tbl file 
GAG> writetbl foo.tbl
