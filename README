Genome Annotation Generator

A console-based program to read, modify, annotate and output genomic data.
Can write files to .gff3 or to the NCBI's .tbl format.


***Example Usage***
In the most basic case, you have a .gff ('organism.gff') and .fasta file ('organism.fasta') 
and you wish to produce a .tbl file for NCBI submission. 

# Run program
python console.py

# Read in data
GAG> readgff organism.gff
GAG> readfasta organism.fasta

# At present we ignore starts and stops when reading the .gff,
# because we found so many errors with our input. So this command is necessary:
GAG> createstartsandstops

# Write .tbl file 
GAG> writetbl foo.tbl

# Go on your merry way
GAG> exit
