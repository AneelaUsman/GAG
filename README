Genome Annotation Generator

A console-based program to read, modify, annotate and output genomic data. Can write files to .gff3 or to the NCBI's .tbl format.


***Example Usage***
In this exciting vignette, you will create a .tbl file from the .fasta and .gff files provided in the 'walkthrough' directory. You should run these commands from within the main GAG directory, or else adjust the file paths.

# Run program
python console.py

# Read in data
GAG> load walkthrough

# Write .tbl file (along with .gff and nucleotides, cds, mrna and protein .fastas) 
GAG> write newfolder

# Go on your merry way
GAG> exit

You now have a folder in your working directory called 'newfolder' containing a .gff, a .fasta and your shiny new .tbl file.
